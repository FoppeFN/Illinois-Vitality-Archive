# How to Search Records

## Filtered Search

### Filtered Search Parameters

These are the parameters for functions listed in [Filtered Search Functions](#filtered-search-functions).

- filters (dict): A dictionary of field, value pairs. See [Fields](#fields) for what is expected inside the dictionary.
- fuzzy (bool): A boolean value indicating whether or not name fields (first_name, middle_name, or last_name) should be discovered via fuzzy search. Fuzzy is false by default.

### Filtered Search Functions

- birth_search(filters, fuzzy)
    - Returns a Django QuerySet of Birth objects based on given [parameters](#filtered-search-parameters).
- death_search(filters, fuzzy)
    - Returns a Django QuerySet of Death objects based on given [parameters](#filtered-search-parameters).
- marriage_search(filters, fuzzy)
    - Returns a Django QuerySet of Marriage objects based on given [parameters](#filtered-search-parameters).

## Narrow Down Search

### Narrow Down Search Parameters

These are the parameters for the [narrow down function](#narrow-down-function).

- query (str): The string that will be searched for across all fields.
- objects (QuerySet): A Django QuerySet as returned by a [filtered search function](#filtered-search-functions).

### Narrow Down Function

- narrow_down(query, objects)
    - Returns a subset of the objects passed in based on the query passed in.

## Fields

The expected structure of [filters](#filtered-search-parameters) for any [filtered search function](#filtered-search-functions) to work properly. Note that no field, value pair is required and any/all can be left empty. All fields and values should be passed in as strings.

Additionally, [wildcards](#wildcards) can be used in values for name fields in the case of non-fuzzy searches. Wildcards will not break a fuzzy search, but may return unexpected results.
